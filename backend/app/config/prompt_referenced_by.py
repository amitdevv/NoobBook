"""
Static map of prompt name → service file paths that consume it.

Surfaced in the admin Prompts editor so an operator editing
``memory_prompt`` can see at a glance "this affects
``memory_service.merge_memory()``" instead of guessing.

Maintained by hand — when a new prompt is added or moved, update this map.
The list is informational; an empty array just hides the breadcrumb in the
UI, nothing else breaks.

Tip when editing: ``grep -r "get_prompt_config(\"<prompt_name>\")"
backend/app/services/`` will show every caller.
