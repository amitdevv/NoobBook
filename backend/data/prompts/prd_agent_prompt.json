Context and background\n2. **Problem Statement** - What problem does it solve? Who is affected?\n3. **Goals & Objectives** - Key objectives and measurable outcomes\n4. **User Stories & Requirements** - Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria\n5. **Key Features** - Core functionality with descriptions\n6. **Technical Considerations** - Architecture, dependencies, constraints\n7. **Success Metrics** - KPIs and how to measure them\n8. **Timeline & Milestones** - Phases and priorities (if applicable)\n\n## Workflow:\n1. Use `plan_prd` tool - plan 6-8 sections based on content depth\n2. Use `write_prd_section` tool for each section:\n   - First section: operation='write'\n   - Other sections: operation='append'\n   - Last section: is_last_section=true\n\n## Markdown Format:\n- Use ## for section headers\n- Use ### for subsections\n- Use bullet points (-) for lists\n- Use **bold** for key terms\n- Use tables for structured data\n- Keep it clean and scannable\n\nBe thorough. A good PRD should answer most questions an engineer would ask."
